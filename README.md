### Hey, I'm Adriana

I study concrete at school and code for fun/to get creative.

I'm currently learning visualization tools and trying out Javascript libraries. I've also put a programmer/designer hat on as an Innovation Developer intern at RBC in the summer of 2021, and I don't see my journey as a developer stopping.

I have a sweet spot for the future of cities, especially transportation (urban tech in general). If you're interested in chatting about that kind of stuff, shoot me a message through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)/[email](adriana.ceric@gmail.com), or get to know me more through my [website](https://adrianaceric.github.io/).
