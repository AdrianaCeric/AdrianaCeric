### Yo, I'm Adriana!
I study concrete at school and code to learn about how to make communities more accessible and sustainable.

I have a sweet spot for the future of cities, especially transportation (urban tech in general). If you're interested in chatting about that kind of stuff, reach out through [email](adriana.ceric@gmail.com). Get to know me better through my [website](https://adrianaceric.github.io/)!
