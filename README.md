## tl;dr
- 👷‍♀️ Incoming a Civil Engineering student @ UWaterloo
- 💻 Incoming **Innovation Developer** [@RBC](https://jobs.rbc.com/ca/en/technology-operations)
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate on any **hackathon** projects (might be a little addicted to them)

### A civil engineering student on Github??
I have a sweet spot for the future of infrastructure and transportation (urban tech in general). To solve our city's biggest challenges, I'll need to leverage epic tech skills, so you might find me at a hackathon or tech internship here and there. On that note, if you're interested in chatting about urban planning or the future of cities, shoot me a message using the links below:
