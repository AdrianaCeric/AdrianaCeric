### currently...
- 👷‍♀️ Civil Engineering student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)
- Larning frontend frameworks and native app dev (React, Gatsby, React Native) and playing around with visualization tools and Javascript libraries

I have a sweet spot for the future of cities, especially transportation (urban tech in general).
